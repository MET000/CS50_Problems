                <span>F</span>ormed in Los Angeles in 1990, Tool emerged as a pioneering force in progressive metal, blending complex rhythms, philosophical lyrics, and avant-garde visuals. The original lineup included vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey, and bassist Paul D’Amour. Their 1992 debut EP, Opiate, showcased their aggressive sound, but it was their first full-length album, Undertow (1993), that propelled them into the mainstream. Featuring hits like "Sober" and "Prison Sex," the album went triple-platinum, cementing their early success.

Their sophomore album, Ænima (1996), marked a creative leap, winning the 1998 Grammy for Best Metal Performance. Tracks like "Stinkfist" and the title song explored themes of personal transformation and societal decay. However, legal disputes with their label delayed subsequent releases.

Integrating mathematical structures and spiritual themes, singles like "Schism" (2002 Grammy winner) underscored their artistic ambition. This was followed by 10,000 Days (2006), another chart-topper featuring epics such as "Vicarious" and "The Pot." Despite mixed reviews, it solidified their legacy before a 13-year hiatus, during which members pursued side projects like A Perfect Circle (Keenan) and MTVoid (Chancellor).
