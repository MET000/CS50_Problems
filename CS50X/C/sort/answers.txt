sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Runtime is much lower with sorted data compared to random data.
Runtime with random data (n=50,000): 6.688s → O(n²)
Runtime with sorted data (n=50,000): 0.0.452s → Ω(n)


sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Lower runtime for random data compared to sort1 and sort3.
Runtime with random data (n=50,000): 0.447s → O(n log n)
Runtime with sorted data (n=50,000): 0.437s → Ω(n log n)


sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Similar runtimes for both sorted and random data, but significantly higher runtimes compared to sort2.
Runtime with random data (n=50,000): 3.000s → O(n²)
Runtime with sorted data (n=50,000): 2.915s → Ω(n²)
