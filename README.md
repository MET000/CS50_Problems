# CS50 Problems Repository

Welcome to the repository where I have uploaded all the problem sets from the CS50X (Introduction to Computer Science), CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python) courses, and CS50R (Introduction to Programming with R).

This repository is organized to help students and learners who are working through the CS50x and CS50p courses on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) or [Harvard Online](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).

## Repository Structure

- **CS50x**: This folder contains all the problem sets and solutions from the CS50X course, focusing on C programming, algorithms, and other core computer science concepts.
  
- **CS50p**: This folder contains all the problem sets and solutions from the CS50P course, which focuses on Python programming and essential programming concepts.

- **CS50R**: This folder contains all the problem sets and solutions from the CS50R course, focusing on R programming and data analysis.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for learning and revisiting the problems and their solutions in CS50x, CS50R, and CS50p. Whether you are currently enrolled in the courses or self-studying, you can find the solutions here to reference and better understand key programming concepts.

## License

This repository is shared for educational purposes. Feel free to clone, fork, or modify the repository as needed. However, it is recommended that you attempt to solve the problems independently before reviewing the solutions.

## Notes

- The solutions in this repository reflect my personal understanding and approach to solving the problems.
- I recommend you go through the course content and try to solve the problems yourself before looking at the solutions in this repository.

Happy coding and learning!
